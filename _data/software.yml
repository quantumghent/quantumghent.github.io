  image: tensorkit.svg
  language: julia
  topic: physics
  description: A package for efficient and large-scale tensor computations, where tensors take a very general definition (inspired from the theory of monoidal categories). Provides support for tensors with arbitrary symmetries (abelian, non-abelian, anyonic and categorical symmetries, a.k.a. fusion categories).

  topic: general
  description: Iterative Krylov-based routines for linear systems, eigenvalue problems and singular values, and matrix functions (such as the exponential function).

  language: julia
  topic: general
  description: An accelorator package to work with strided arrays, i.e. dense arrays whose memory layout has a fixed stride along every dimension. Strided.jl does not make any assumptions about the strides (such as stride 1 along first dimension, or monotonously increasing strides) and provides multithreaded and cache friendly implementations for mapping, reducing, broadcasting such arrays, as well as taking views, reshaping and permuting dimensions.

  language: julia
  topic: general
  description: A package for matrix free computations with linear maps. LinearMaps.jl provides a type to wrap an arbitrary function (which represents the action of a linear map on a vector) in a structure that behaves similar to a matrix, in that it has a two-dimensional shape. Linear maps can be multiplied and added and combined with other matrices or linear maps, without ever doing the explicit computation, but such that an efficient implementation of the resulting matrix vector product is provided.
