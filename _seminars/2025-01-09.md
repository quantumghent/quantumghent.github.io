Symmetry is one of the guiding principles in physics. Recently, the concept of global symmetry has been generalized, encompassing higher form symmetry, subsystem symmetry and non-invertible symmetry. This generalization has profound applications in both quantum field theories and quantum spin systems. In the first part of my talk, I will briefly review this recent development and its applications in spin models, including my work on constructing non-invertible symmetries in models with subsystem symmetry and dipole symmetry. In the second part, I will focus on the symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetry. I will give a general way to classify these new phases and construct the corresponding lattice models. There exist anomalous edge modes at the interface of two distinct SPT phases, which could serve as a potential way to detect these non-invertible symmetries.
