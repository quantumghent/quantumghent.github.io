The ``entanglement asymmetry'' quantifies the extent to which a quantum state breaks a given symmetry. This concept has been applied to study thermalization, where initially symmetry-breaking states evolve into symmetric ones. To better understand this quantity, it is valuable to analyze its behavior in well-understood reference states, such as the ground states of specific models. In this talk, I will discuss recent findings on the entanglement asymmetry in the ground states of gapless (1+1)-dimensional models, described by conformal field theories.

The talk will be based on
