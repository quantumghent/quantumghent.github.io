title: "Quantum Hall states in optical lattices: From skyrmions to hidden order"
type: seminar
abstract: true

The study of interacting quantum Hall states and their
exotic anyonic excitations poses a major challenge in current experimental
and theoretical research. Quantum simulators, in particular cold atoms in
optical lattices, provide a promising platform to realize, manipulate, and
understand such systems with unprecedented control. In this talk, I will
discuss how the local spin and density resolution of quantum gas
microscopes extends the toolbox of quantum Hall physics with an emphasis on
spinful, fermionic systems.First, I will discuss the interplay of spin and
charge in quantum Hall states, resulting in ferromagnetism and skyrmionic
spin-textures [1,2]. I will show how different types of interactions lead
to the stability of different classes of states and will present
experimentally relevant signatures to identify these states. Then, I will
turn towards a fundamental question regarding the topological order of
quantum Hall states: the speculated condensation of composite bosons
exhibiting quasi long-range order. I will exemplify this mechanism in
fermionic [2] and bosonic [3] systems and touch upon its detectability in
tensor network simulations and quantum gas microscopes.
