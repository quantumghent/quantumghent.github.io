Understanding and simulating the dynamics of open quantum
many-body systems remain challenging due to the interplay of noise and
correlations. In this seminar, we present two complementary approaches
aimed at addressing these challenges. First, we introduce an optimization
framework for trajectory-based stochastic methods to simulate systems with
local noise. By adaptively selecting stochastic propagators to minimize
average trajectory entanglement, we achieve significant reductions in the
classical computational cost when using matrix product states. This
strategy not only offers an exponential improvement over conventional
methods but also provides insights into mixed-state entanglement measures
and connects to phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions.
Second, we turn to the problem of simulating the collective dynamics of
emitter arrays near one-dimensional waveguides, a setting critical for
quantum optics experiments. While tensor-network methods face limitations
due to the rapid growth of correlations, we explore an alternative
neural-network-based approach to overcome these challenges. This method
demonstrates promise in efficiently capturing the collective dynamics,
paving the way for accurate simulations in experimentally relevant regimes.
