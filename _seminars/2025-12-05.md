title: "Statistics-Encoded Tensor Network Approach to Disorder-Averaged Quantum Dynamics"
type: seminar
abstract: true
---

Disorder-averaged dynamics in
quantum many-body systems are challenging to simulate, due to the loss of
translational invariance and the need for extensive disorder sampling. In
this talk, I will introduce the statistics-encoded tensor network (SeTN), a
method that embeds disorder into an auxiliary tensor layer, averages
locally, and restores translational invariance after compression. A
universal criterion $n \gg \alpha^2 t^2$ ensuring compression efficiency
emerges from the singular-value structure, linking Trotter resolution,
disorder strength, and evolution time. As an application, I will show how
SeTN captures the spectral form factor of the disordered transverse-field
Ising model, where the long-time dynamics are governed by a single leading
transfer-matrix eigenvalue, which differsfrom the behavior of Floquet
models.
