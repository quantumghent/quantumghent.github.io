Holographic dualities have driven high energy theory research for many years but have recently become intertwined with quantum information ideas. At the center of this connection is a representation of entanglement and quantum error correction in critical theories by higher-dimensional or "bulk" quantities with gravitational features.
In this talk, I give an overview of the key developments of this exciting field and explain how models of holographic quantum error correction can be understood from a both a high energy and condensed matter perspective. In the context of the latter, I also mention my recent work on the renormalization group flow of a certain class of holographic codes.
