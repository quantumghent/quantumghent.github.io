I will attempt to shed some light on the connections between several integrable lattice systems. Our journey will start with RSOS models and we will travel to the realms of vertex, loop and cluster models. We will discuss their continuum limit, conformal spectrum and symmetries. I will give an elementary example for percolation or the Ising case where certain representations exhibit Jordan cells and connect the vertex model to the RSOS one.
