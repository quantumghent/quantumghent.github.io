We present a continuous tensor-network construction for the states of quantum fields called cPEPS (continuous projected entangled pair state), which enjoys the same spatial and global symmetries of ground-states of relativistic field theories. We explicitly show how such a state can approximate and eventually converge to the free field theory vacuum and suggest a regularization-independent way of estimating the convergence via a universal term in the fidelity per-site. We also present a detailed bottom-up construction of the cPEPS as the continuum limit of the conventional lattice Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS).
