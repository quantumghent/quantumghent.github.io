We apply the higher categorical framework of enriched fusion categories 
to characterize and study domain walls between anomalous topological 
orders.  In our approach, we fix a 3+1D bulk anomaly described by a UMTC 
A, and view 2+1D topological orders as A-enriched fusion categories. We 
then explain how to characterize (and perform computations with) 
topological domain walls in a manner closely paralleling the 
non-anomalous case in terms of A-enriched bimodule categories. Based on 
joint work with Peter Huston, Fiona Burnell, and David Penneys.
