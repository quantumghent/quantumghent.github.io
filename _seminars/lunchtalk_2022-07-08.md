Entanglement is the fundamental difference between classical and quantum systems and has become one of the guiding principles in the exploration of high- and low-energy physics.
The calculation of entanglement entropies in interacting quantum field theories, however, remains challenging.
In this talk, I will present a method for the computation of reduced density matrices of interacting quantum field theories using Hamiltonian truncation.

We will start with an introduction to Hamiltonian truncation and move towards computing entanglement entropies in this framework.

The talk is based on 2202.11113.
