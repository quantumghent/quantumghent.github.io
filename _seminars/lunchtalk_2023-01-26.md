We study fault-tolerant error correction in a quantum memory constructed as a two-dimensional model of Fibonacci anyons on a torus, in the presence of thermal noise represented by pair-creation processes and measurement errors. The correction procedure is based on the cellular automaton decoders originating in the works of [GÃ¡cs](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0000(86)90002-4) and [Harrington](https://doi.org/10.7907/AHMQ-EG82). Through numerical simulations, we observe that this code behaves fault-tolerantly and that threshold behavior is likely present. Hence, we provide strong evidence for the existence of a fault-tolerant universal non-Abelian topological quantum computer.
