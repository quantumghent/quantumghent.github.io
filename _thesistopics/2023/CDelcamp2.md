An extremely powerful and ubiquitous concept in theoretical physics is that of <strong>duality</strong>, loosely defined as a non-trivial physical equivalence between distinct theories. The existence of a duality is typically rooted in a common mathematical structure underlying seemingly very different theories. One appeal of dualities is that certain computations that are difficult in a given theory may be much easier in a dual theory. Throughout history, dualities have played a significant role in producing numerous landmark results, spanning from groundbreaking solutions to statistical mechanical problems to opening up new avenues in the study of quantum gravity.

In the context of quantum lattice models, dualities can be thought of as maps between distinct concrete realizations of a common abstract <strong>symmetry</strong>. Guided by the modern perspective on symmetries in terms of <strong>topological defects</strong> [1], these various realizations can be encoded into higher mathematical structures, which pertain to <strong>category theory</strong>, belonging to a common equivalence class.

These formal concepts were recently made very concrete using the language of <strong>tensor networks</strong>. Amongst other things, tensor networks can be used to translate abstract category theoretic notions into actual lattice operators. In addition to shedding light on seemingly familiar dualities, this had led to new physical discoveries [2]. So far this approach to dualities has been primarily employed to study one-dimensional quantum lattice models. A generalization to higher dimensions was outlined in [3] but its potential awaits to be tapped into.


#### Goal

The goal of this project is to generalize the framework presented in [3] and apply it to probe the space of two-dimensional quantum lattice models, which remains largely unexplored. After familiarizing themself with the relevant algebraic structures, the student will extend the framework of [3] so as to accommodate a broader class of quantum lattice models, before considering explicit examples of great physical interest such as (2+1)d Heisenberg-like models. This project is well suited for students interested in mathematical physics.
