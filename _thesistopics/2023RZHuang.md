#### Context

Quantum phases in nature are classfied to be gapped or gapless. With the protection of an energy gap, one can use symmetry to classfify quantum phases. It turns out one can use the symmetry group and its extended algebraic structure, such as the group extensions, to characterise all these phases. The nontrivial symmetric class of phases are termed as topological order. With the existence of symmetry and energy gap, one class of phases can not be smoothly connected to another one. These symmetric phases are closely related the symmetry group and are called symmetry-enriched phases. There also exist topological order which does not require the symmetry protection, for which there are emergent fractionalized degrees of freedom. 

When the energy gap closes and re-opens, a quantum phase transition happens, during which one quantum phase can be changed to another different one. At the critical point, there emerges scale invariance. The physics there is universal and is not related to the detail of the corresponding original theory. It is only determined by the space dimension and symmetries of the original theory. These interesting physics is termed as universal quantum critical behavior. When put on a closed manifold, the quantum phase transition forgets the information of the gapped phases near the critical point. For example, there is nothing different between a conventional symmetry-breaking transition or a topological phase transition both described by a Ising conformal field theory. It seems the nontrivial properties of the symmetry-enriched phases can not affect the critical point at all. 

However, this is not true if we put the theory at an open manifold. When there exists a surface in the system, the geometry of the system is dramatically changed and there exist new interesting physics near the surface or boundary, the surface critical behavior. It turns out that, with a given bulk universality, there can be very different surface critical behaviors. Recently it was found transitions between topologically ordered phases can host nontrivial surface critical behaviors without any fine tune of the Hamiltonian. Such nontrivial surface critical behaviors stem from the fractionalized physical degrees in the topologically ordered states. So that there can emerge unconventional boundary operators near the boundary. This means the symmetry-enchment can affect the phase transition on open manifolds. 

In one space dimension, the surface critical behaivor can be classfied by conformal boundaries. So that one can systematically study how the symmetry-enchment affect critical theories through the famous boudary conformal field theories (BCFT). However, there stil lacks a general theory to systematically understand the boundary condition or states. More importantly without conformal symmetry, one can not rely on the BCFT. It would be even much more complicated in higher space dimensions.

In this project, we propose to study symmetry-enched quantum critical points without conformal symmetries. Such phenomena can happen if there is no rotation symmetry between space and time. Through a systematic numerical and pertrubation BCFT analysis, we are going to understand new boundary critical behaviors. 


#### Goal

First, we are going to understand a symmetry-enriched quantum critical point without conformal symmetry on a open quantum system. A non-conformal symmetric theory is realized by a theory with a non-linear energy dispersion, the chiral clock spin chain. The symmetry-enrichment is going to be realized by the so-called decorated domain-wall approach. By using another different gapped spin degrees of freedom, we are able to symmetry twist the original theory. Its gapped phase can be classfied using the usual cohomology group. By applying tensor network based numerical methods, we can easily calculate its low energy spectrum and various correlation functions. Comparing these spectrum with those from pertrubative conformal field theory, we are going to analyse how the conformal boudaries change and how the symmetry affect the boudary conditions. 

Second, we are also going to study the entanglement properties of such theories defined on a closed manifold. Although there is no physical boudaries, one need to cut the whole system into two parts to study the entanglement. Hence entanglement boudaries are generated. The entanglement measures the correlation between a subregion and its rest part. With the reduced matrix defined using the ground state wave function, one can define an entanglement Hamiltonian. It was conjectured that the spectra of the entanglement Hamiltonian correspond to the spectra of the Hamiltonian of the subregion with certain physical boundaries. We are going to explore whether such conjectures still apply or how they are changed in our new theories.
