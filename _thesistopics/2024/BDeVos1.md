#### Context

An exciting property of a large class of condensed matter lattice systems is the emerging scale invariance at their quantum critical points where a phase transition occurs. At these points, it is understood that the low-energy physics can be captured by **conformal field theories** (CFTs). Various difficulties arise when it comes to modelling the critical behavior of these strongly correlated systems. One approach to modelling these critical lattice models is through **tensor networks** (TNs), [1] a theoretical and numerical toolbox that has been developed in our research group and is used worldwide to efficiently deal with strongly correlated quantum systems. [2]

Recently, many communities in theoretical physics have come to exploit the connection between symmetries and so-called topological defects described by a **fusion category**. Tensor networks fit naturally in this, since the relevant symmetries can be imposed directly in numerical algorithms, allowing for significant computational speedup. Lattice models exhibiting these symmetries can be explicitly constructed as topological TN states, while the symmetries represented by topological defects can be seen as TN operators. The student will further develop this dictionary between CFTs and critical lattice models from a topological perspective.

An approach rising in popularity is the strange correlator, which provides the critical lattice model with corresponding symmetries from top-down. What is yet to be done is to write down the local observables of the related CFT, known as the **primary operators**, in terms of these topological objects, and to investigate the connection to the TN operators. This is a bottom-up approach which would provide us with the building blocks of more general lattice models. [3,4] It is precisely this bottom-up approach that the student will develop.

#### Goal

The goal of this project is to construct a tensor network representation of the primary operators of the CFT corresponding to a class of critical lattice models. Any progress in this direction is highly beneficial for efficient and accurate numerical simulations of lattice models near criticality.

The student would first familiarise themselves with fusion category theory, as this is the natural language for discussing the symmetries and topological defects of the considered models. Parallel to this, the student would become accustomed to the numerical tensor network toolbox [2]. With these tools in hand, the first task will consist of developing a good and general TN ansatz for primary operators. Using this ansatz it is possible to calculate many quantities of interest such as correlation functions for many different critical models.

The project will be carried out in an international research environment. This project is well-suited for students with a keen interest in mathematical physics and numerical simulations. However, a background in category theory or tensor networks is not required.
