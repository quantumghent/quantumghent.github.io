#### Context

At the heart of quantum many-body physics lies a deep question: how does collective behavior emerge from individual particle properties? A rather fundamental example is how a collection of elementary fermions —whether spatially delocalized Cooper pairs in superconductors, strongly bound protons and neutrons in ultracold alkali atoms, or paired fermionic atoms in superfluid He3— can effectively exhibit macroscopic quantum coherence. Despite their diverse physical realizations, these systems share a common feature: under suitable conditions, a composite entity comprised of elementary fermions can effectively behave as bosons. However, this is just an approximation that is expected to break down when the composite bosons overlap significantly, as observed in exciton condensates. There are then two natural questions that arise: Can we define a quantitative measure of compositeness that sets a strict criterion for when an entity can truly be treated as a boson? And when this condition fails, how does the statistics of the internal structure manifest in the deviation of physical observables from ideal bosonic behavior? While it is now well known that the validity of treating a bound pair as a single elementary entity is not solely dictated by strong interactions but rather by the preservation of entanglement between its constituent fermions [1], the precise way in which this compositeness affects measurable quantities remains an unexplored question.

#### Goal

This project aims to systematically explore the compositeness effects of bosons by formulating a 1D lattice model of interacting fermions with tunable interaction strengths, similar to Ref [2]. While Ref [2] examined the conditions under which a collection of 2N fermions effectively organize into N bosons of 2 particles, or N/2 bosons of 4 particles, etc, our focus will be on exploring the subsequent deviation of observable quantities like condensate density and phase coherence, and how these effects can be understood through the entanglement structure of the system. This will largely be facilitated through the use of Matrix Product State (MPS) techniques, with the possibility of incorporating an analytical perspective through the study of an integrable model, depending on the student’s interests.
