#### Context

High-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials remains one of the most intriguing, challenging, and highly debated problems in the field of condensed matter physics. Despite decades of research, the exact mechanism responsible for Cooper-pairing and the superconducting phase in these materials is still not fully understood. The cuprates exhibit a complex phase diagram characterized by a plethora of competing orders (e.g charge- and spin-density-waves, pseudogap phase, strange metal etc.), including antiferromagnetic (AFM) order [1,2]. More specifically on the electron doping side of the phase diagram, where it is strongly believed that the AFM order is the parent state for the superconducting phase, new experimental foundings suggest the unconventional pairing to be mediated through AFM spin-fluctuations, which are the finite temperature remnants of the Goldstone modes that arise in the system due to spontaneous symmetry breaking of the SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry in the AFM order [3]. Further, recent studies and theoretical proposals indicate a strong Fermi-surface reconstruction as a function of (electron-)doping. A similar reconstruction has recently been observed by thermal agitation through the appearance of a so called gossamer Fermi-surface [4]. Understanding the interplay between these phases, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the Fermi-surface reconstruction is crucial for deciphering mysteries and understanding the fundamental nature of superconductivity in cuprates.
#### Goal

The goal of this project is to combine numerical as well as theoretical skills to explore the intricate connection between spontaneous symmetry breaking and superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates, as well as investigate the effects of the gossamer Fermi-surface on the superconducting phase. We explore the AFM state, which spontaneously breaks SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry, as a parent state for the superconducting phase, which is then mediated purely by AFM spin-fluctuations rather then phonons. As the parent state exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking, the electronic system will have low-energy collective excitations corresponding to Goldstone modes of the broken symmetry (spin-fluctuations for spontaneous breaking of spin SU(2) symmetry). The student will solve for these Goldstone modes via a newly developed framework by the promoter, using a generalized random phase approximation approach and the resulting Bethe-Salpeter equation, and investigate their capability of mediating a favorable superconducting interaction [5]. In a next step the Fermi-surface reconstruction and gossamer Fermi-surface with be explored by thermal activation of virtual processes. The student will introduce Feynman diagrammatic corrections to the fermionic and bosonic propagators and investigate it's effect on the superconducting dome, trying to make connection to recent experimental work related to the gossamer Fermi-surface, further deeping our understanding on a topic which has remained elusive for decennia.
