#### Context

Classifying quantum phases of matters is one of the most significant objectives in condensed matter physics. By understanding the physical properties and their mechanisms, we can design the materials for our purposes. Yet, the macroscopic mechanism is often not obvious from the microscopic models, making it a challenging task for physicists. One strategy is to look at the phase boundaries. There, the systems often exhibit universal properties that reflect the underlying macroscopic models. The renormalisation group (RG) is an idea that captures this: we can classify universality classes of models sharing universal properties at phase boundaries, which are fixed points of RG flows. 

RG flows can capture various phase transitions. In particular, fixed points of second-order phase transitions can often be described by a **conformal field theory** (CFT), which unlocks a powerful toolbox to understand universality classes. First-order phase transitions, on the other hand, do not show the necessary conformal invariance to accurately be captured by a CFT. However, it has been known historically that some weakly-first order phase transitions such as that of the five-state Potts model, exhibit approximate conformal invariance. Recently, such phase transitions has been shown to be still described by an analytic continuation of CFTs, called complex CFTs [2]. These have been shown to be applicable in various condensed matter/statistical physics systems, as well as in high-energy physics.

CFTs are analytically tractable in two dimensions due to conformal symmetry considerations. For this reason, most of the works in the literature studying critical lattice models do so in two dimensions. However, numerics allow us to access various conformal data in other dimensions, notably in 3D. One such development is the **fuzzy sphere regularisation**, which has proven to detect the fingerprints of CFTs accurately [3], and opens the gateway to realisations of various 3D CFTs. In particular, a possible connection to complex CFTs has been made with the 3-state Potts model in 2+1D [4], where the phase transition is first-order, but shows approximate conformal invariance.

#### Goal

This project will start off with a literature study into the relevance of complex conformal field theories in condensed matter contexts. The student will first familiarise themselves with real CFT, and how these are related to criticality and renormalisation group. Afterwards, the student is fully equipped to tackle complex CFT. Finally, the student is asked to perform some original work related to [4], which can be approached from various angles, and especially from the numerical point of view. **Tensor networks**, a most popular theoretical and numerical toolbox that has been developed in our research group to study strongly correlated quantum systems, will come into play on the fuzzy sphere.

The project can be tailored to the wishes and interests of the student in terms of which research topics they want to delve into. 

This project is well-suited for students with a keen interest in mathematical, theoretical and computational physics. No prior knowledge on any of the mentioned topics above is required; a large part of this project concerns understanding these connections more deeply.
