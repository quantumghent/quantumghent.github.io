#### Context

An extremely powerful and ubiquitous concept in theoretical physics is that of duality, loosely defined as a non-trivial physical equivalence between distinct theories. The existence of a duality is typically rooted in a common mathematical structure underlying seemingly very different theories. One appeal of dualities is that certain computations that are difficult in a given theory may be much easier in a dual theory. In the context of quantum lattice models, dualities have recently been classified and constructed in terms of tensor networks in one spatial dimension [1,2], and progress has been made in (2+1)d [3,4]. This entanglement based approach to dualities has not only allowed for a concrete realization of the operators implementing the dualities explicitly on the lattice but has also led to an understanding of how quantum phases of matter can be converted into each other.

Closely related to the concept of dualities is that of non-invertible symmetries. As their name suggests these symmetries are characterized by the absence of an inverse for some of the symmetry operators, so that the resulting symmetry structure is not anymore described by a group. A systemic way of obtaining such symmetry structures is exactly via the aforementioned duality procedures.

#### Goal

Recent attention has been devoted to the concept of symmetry-protected topological phases protected by non-invertible symmetries [5,6,7]. These phases are characterized by having a unique gapped ground state and, when put on open lattices, by gapless edge and interface modes. It has been shown that these phases are a particularly well-suited resource for quantum computing schemes based on measurements. The goal of this topic would be to systematically construct examples of such phases and study their properties in the tensor network framework. This project is well suited for a student with a keen interest in mathematical physics and entanglement theory.
