#### Context

An intriguing property of a large class of many-body lattice systems is the emerging local scale invariance at their critical points where a phase transition occurs. At these points, it is understood that the low-energy physics can be captured by **conformal field theories** (CFTs). Various challenges arise when it comes to modelling the critical behavior of these strongly correlated systems. One approach to modelling these critical lattice models is via a **tensor network** (TN) representation of their partition function [1]. In our research group we have developed a plethora of numerical algorithms and a numerical toolbox to optimize and renormalize these tensor networks [2].

Through the lens of tensor network renormalization [4,5], ref. [3] proposed a method to extract the local observables of a CFT, known as the **primary operators**. The method relies on a tensor network representation of the (discrete) local rescaling operator on the level of the partition function.

#### Goal

The goal of this thesis is study the approach of ref. [3] to CFT operators on the lattice, incorporate it in our toolbox and conduct state-of-the art research with the developed code.

The student would first familiarize themselves with the numerical tensor network toolbox developed in our group [2]. They would then reproduce the results of [3,4,5] and benchmark the codebase. Subsequently the student can improve upon the results of in several ways. One avenue which can be pursued would be to compute correlation functions involving the found primary operators. The student could also investigate how the so-called topological symmetries of the conformal models can be incorporated.

The project will be carried out in an international research environment. This project is well-suited for students with a keen interest in mathematical physics and numerical simulations.
