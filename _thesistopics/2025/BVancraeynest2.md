#### Context

An extremely powerful and ubiquitous concept in theoretical physics is that of duality, loosely defined as a non-trivial physical equivalence between distinct theories. The existence of a duality is typically rooted in a common mathematical structure underlying seemingly very different theories. One appeal of dualities is that certain computations that are difficult in a given theory may be much easier in a dual theory. In the context of quantum lattice models, dualities have recently been classified and constructed in terms of tensor networks in one spatial dimension [1,2], and progress has been made in (2+1)d [3,4]. This entanglement based approach to dualities has not only allowed for a concrete realization of the operators implementing the dualities explicitly on the lattice but has also led to an understanding of how quantum phases of matter can be converted into each other.

Closely related to the concept of dualities is that of non-invertible symmetries. As their name suggests these symmetries are characterized by the absence of an inverse for some of the symmetry operators, so that the resulting symmetry structure is not anymore described by a group. A systemic way of obtaining such symmetry structures is exactly via the aforementioned duality procedures.

#### Goal

The most well-known instance of a duality is the celebrated Kramers-Wannier duality. Applied to the one‚Äêdimensional quantum transverse-field Ising model, it was found that the theory could be expressed either in terms of spin or domain wall degrees of freedom. These two formulations are related by a non-local mapping and describe the same physical system at different values of the interaction strengths; the ordered phase is mapped to the disordered phase and vice versa. By requiring the duality to leave the system invariant, the exact value of the critical coupling can be identified.

The goal of this topic is to further expand the results of [2,3,4] in the two-dimensional setting. Warming up with completely working out the Kramers-Wannier duality in two dimensions in the presence of all boundary conditions, the student will then turn to more exotic dualities involving the gauging of charge conjugation [5,6]. This project is well suited for a student with a keen interest in mathematical physics and entanglement theory.
