#### Context

The **Bose-Einstein condensate** (BEC) is a phase of matter, consisting of many (+10.000) interacting ultra-cold bosonic atoms in the quantum regime. The collective quantum many-body nature of the BEC gives rise to peculiar emergent behavior, admitting topologically non-trivial excitations such as vortices and solitons, linked to superfluidity.
Solitons are localized waves that propagate without losing their shape thanks to the balance between nonlinear and dispersive effects in a medium. They can be observed in various situations such as shallow water, fiber optics and, indeed, superfluids. It is the latter context that we want to explore with this thesis.

Already in 2000, 5 years after the first creation of a BEC, solitons were generated in these systems, see Ref [1]. The procedure consisted of laser-imprinting an appropriate phase difference onto the BEC wavefunction. In recent years, the spectacular advances in experimental techniques have facilitated a higher degree of control and manipulation of atomic gases enabling more finetuned protocols. In Ref [2] they demonstrate a technique to create more versatile soliton-settings, paving the way to study more **involved soliton-physics** such as multiple solitons interacting.

Since 2022, our group hosts a state-of-the-art experiment where BECs can be manipulated with programmable laser light and magnetic fields.

#### Goal
The goal of the thesis is to study and engineer methods as described in Ref [2] in our own lab with the aim to create solitons at arbitrary position and velocity.
As such, the student has the opportunity to **develop and apply numerical methods and quantum optics theory on a cutting-edge quantum experiment**.

The student will start by familiarizing themselves with the theoretical description of solitons in BECs. Using existing numerical packages, example experiments can be simulated. Once the physics behind the protocol is understood, the student will adapt it to our experimental set-up. Since our system uses a different light-shaping technique, namely Acousto Optic Deflectors (AODs) instead of Digital Micromirror Devices (DMDs) as in Ref [2], the student will engineer different optimal protocols suited to the actual experiment.

This thesis draws from different fields: quantum optics, quantum field theory, numerical analysis and cold atom physics. As the thesis fits within a larger research goal of our group, depending on their interests and skills the student will have the freedom to focus more on the theoretical, numerical or experimental part of the project.
