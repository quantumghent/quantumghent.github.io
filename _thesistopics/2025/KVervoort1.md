#### Context

This master thesis investigates tensor networks and its application to disordered spin chains. Disordered spin chains are spin chains where the coupling parameters, like magnetic field strength, are not constant but random. These systems exhibit many interesting phenomenon like power law behaviour of correlations and rare regions dominating expectation values. Tensor Network (TN) methods [1] have been pivotal in understanding the behavior of various quantum many-body systems, especially in 1D. However it remains a challenge for traditional TN approaches to simulate models with strong disorder. Recently a new tensor network algorithm has been developed by the Quantum Group at Ghent University to tackle random systems at finite temperatures in 1D. This algorithm restores the translational invariance in the disordered system by representing the density matrix as a matrix product operator (MPO), such that the power of MPO's can be exploited. This new algorithm opens the door to new simulations of the vast realm of random spin chains.

#### Goal

The overall goal of the thesis is to study and explore disordered quantum systems through tensor networks. The first part of the thesis consists of a literature study on tensor networks and disordered models. The student will use the tensor network toolbox developed by our group to perform novel simulations of random spin systems. Depending on the interest of the student different research directions can be pursued. One possibility is to use the existing code base to simulate a plethora of random systems and study their phase diagram. A second possibility is to optimize and benchmark the current implementation of the algorithm and extend it with symmetries. This will allow the student to tackle more challenging models like the Heisenberg model, where the exploitation of symmetries will be necessary. Thirdly the student can look into developing an analogue of the algorithm for zero temperature groundstates.
