#### Context

This master thesis investigates tensor networks and its application to disordered spin chains. Disordered spin chains are spin chains where the coupling parameters, like magnetic field strength, are not constant but random. These systems exhibit many interesting phenomenon like power law behaviour of correlations and rare regions dominating expectation values. Tensor Network (TN) methods [1] have been pivotal in understanding the behavior of various quantum many-body systems, especially in 1D. However it remains a challenge for traditional TN approaches to simulate models with strong disorder. Recently a new tensor network algorithm has been developed by the Quantum Group at Ghent University to tackle random systems at finite temperatures in 1D. This algorithm restores the translational invariance in the disordered system by representing the density matrix as a matrix product operator (MPO), such that the power of MPO's can be exploited. This new algorithm opens the door to new simulations of the vast realm of random spin chains.

#### Goal

The overall goal of the thesis is to study and explore quantum repeaters by using tensor networks. The first part of the thesis consists of a literature study on quantum repeaters and quantum entanglement distillation. Secondly the student tries to form a tensor network description of a quantum repeater. For this goal the construction of a MPS from projected entangled pairs will be a good starting point. The student can investigate, by using this tensor network description, which quantum repeater protocols are more optimal. Lastly the student can also investigate the effect of noise and imperfect measurements on the protocols. Depending on the interest of the student one can also look at how to perform entanglement distillation with MPS. Here the student can investigate what measurements are optimal to extract maximally entangled pairs from multiple copies of a MPS.
