#### Context

One of the ultimate goals in physics is to classify and understand all possible phases of matter. A particularly intriguing development in this program has been the discovery of topological properties in quantum systems leading to exotic phases of matter. Cold atom experiments have arisen as a powerful toolbox for exploring such phases in a highly controllable setting [1]. One interesting proposal to realise such topological phases is through the use of ’synthetic dimensions’. Here one leverages periodic driving to engineer a time-averaged Hamiltonian, a technique known as Floquet engineering, to realise a dimensional degree of freedom along the internal states of the system. The coupling along this synthetic dimension can be tuned to implement artificial gauge fields and magnetic fluxes in the system [2] thereby opening up the possibility of realising the paradigmatic quantum Hall effect.

One proposal of implementing a synthetic dimension uses a setup very similar to our BEC-lab where one ’shakes’ a harmonically trapped gas to couple the internal states along the trap [3]. The dynamics within this synthetic dimension were recently verified [4,5] and are being considered as a way to experimentally realise the paradigmatic quantum Hall effect in a non-electronic system. The technical requirements of this proposal appear to be within the reach of our future experiments, motivating a thorough exploration of its theoretical aspects.

#### Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a general theoretical understanding of a 2D realization of the system discussed above, using a blend of theory and numerics. After a comprehensive introduction to cold atom physics and the quantum Hall effect, we will first examine the non-interacting case. A particularly interesting direction is exploring how the center-of-mass motion reflects the non-trivial topological properties of the band spectrum, as demonstrated in a remarkable experiment on a different system [6]. A key question to address in this context is the state preparation process. With a solid understanding of the non-interacting regime, the student can explore the effects of including weak interactions. The setup inherently gives rise to long-range anisotropic interactions, which are expected to lead to exotic ground-state physics. The field of cold atom physics thrives on the synergy between theory and experiment; therefore, this project is ideal for students with a strong interest in both theoretical and experimental physics, especially those eager to explore exotic quantum phenomena and engage in interdisciplinary physics research.
